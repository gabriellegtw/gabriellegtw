Hi! I am Gabrielle (Or you can just call me Gab). I am currently a Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.

I have dabbled in backend and data-related technologies and I am excited to learn more about them through more projects/internships. Some of my recent projects include FounderFinder, a dating app-style application which aims to connect budding startup founders, as well as Deep Tech categorisation which categorises startups based on whether they are a deep tech startup or not. I am currently on the lookout for backend or data science/ML-related internships.
